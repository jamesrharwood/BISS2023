Poorly described research üö´ patient outcomes ‚ò†Ô∏è

::: {.notes}
Poorly described research doesn't improve patient outcomes.

Even though there are +500 RGs...

...and even though a third of journals recommend at least some of them

Research articles still omit key information. 

RGs have had limited impact...[TURN]

...and I spent the first year of my PhD trying to find out why through a synthesis of qualitative evidence and an audit of JAGs. 

I found 32 factors that may limit RG adherance...

...the behaviour change wheel - an evidence based framework, based on the COM-B model of behaviour, that helps you to systematically design and define behaviour change interventions.

You start with behavioural drivers. 
* Capability - not knowing or understanding something, 
* opportunity - not having time or resources, and 
* motivation  - not wanting or needing something. 

You target these with different types of intervention. And interventions can be delivered in different ways. 

To make a medical analogy, you can consider the middle ring to be drugs, and the other ring are how you administer them.

This wheel seems simple but actually encompasses all techniques from behaviour change theory. 

I helped the EQUATOR Network - based in Botnar - to use the wheel to do a behavioural analysis of the barriers and ideas, and to design intervention changes. 

We were starting with a long list of ideas - 136 of them...

Affordability, Practicablility, likely Efficacy, Acceptability, Side-effects, and Equity. Together these are the APEASE criteria. 

...and we ended up ruling out incentivization, restriction and coerscion as types of intervention because we found them to be inequitable and potentially unacceptable. 

...With regards to delivery options, as a small research unit we don't have the power to create new laws or offer money. 

...EQUATOR _could_ offer new services, but I, as a PhD student, was limited to improving things that already exist.

## Designing intervention components

### &ensp;

![](assets/STROBE1.png){}

::: {.notes}
Here's the STROBE checklist. The most used reporting guideline checklist.

Authors often fill this out as a beurocratic part of journal submission, when it's far too late to act on the guidance, and they may never read the full guidance, which is in a separate publication.

How could we fix this? 

One of the 136 ideas, a real mind-blowing rocket-science idea, is...
:::

### [Capability]{.green}

![](assets/STROBE2.png)

::: {.notes}
...to _TELL_ authors to read the full guidance before they write. Some authors simply won't know that guidance exists, or when to use it. So we should tell them. This is an example of using education to target capability.
:::

## Designing intervention components

### [Opportunity]{.green}

![](assets/STROBE3.png)

::: {.notes}
...we could including tools specifically for earlier stages of work, using _enablement_ to target an _opportunity_ barrier. 
:::

### [Motivation]{.green}

![](assets/STROBE4.png)

::: {.notes}
...and we could use _persuasion_ to _motivate_ authors to use guidance.

This is an example of how you can "design" a single sentence, using multiple intervention functions - education, enablement, and persuasion - to target barriers driven by a lack of capability, opportunity, and motication.

**Item 5. Qualitative approach and research paradigm:**

::: {.fragments}
The research paradigm is the set of beliefs and assumptions that guide the research process. These commonly include positivist, post-positivist, constructivist or interpretivist, and critical theory. Qualitative research generally draws from a post-positivist or constructivist/interpretivist paradigm. [We recommend identifying the research paradigm]{.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=1} so that readers understand whether the researcher assumes that there is a single, objective reality (positivist or post-positivist) and has thus designed the study to describe this reality or whether the researcher assumes multiple, subjective realities and designed the study to describe these multiple realities, with no attempt to merge or reconcile these realities (constructivist/interpretivist). The paradigm has implications for the study design, approach, methods, and techniques to ensure rigor and trustworthiness.

Qualitative research includes an array of approaches and methodologies, both general (e.g., qualitative content analysis, general inductive approach) and specific (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenography). Since the research paradigm does not necessarily dictate particular approaches or methods, [the approach should also be clearly defined]{.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=1}. Stating the approach provides readers the opportunity to evaluate the fidelity of the research approach to the research question(s) and consider the rationale for modifications and deviations from the selected approach. Qualitative research also includes an array of methods that can be used across paradigms and approaches. (See also Item 10) [The researcher should explain why the selected approach is appropriate for the research question]{.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=1}, and [provide references to theories or traditions that guide the use of the approach as needed]{.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=1}.

We can do the same with entire paragraphs

You don't need to read all this, but see if you tell how many things it's advising you to write.

It's not easy.

...there are 4 things.

...campared with this

You can imediately see 4 chunks of consice text. We've moved the definitions to pop-ups - those dotted lines - and justification and examples are there in the dropdown if you need them. 

We've used direct language and tried to be reassuring, and added a discussion feature to ask questions and give feedback.
