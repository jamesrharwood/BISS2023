And interventions can be delivered in different ways.\nTo make a medical analogy, you can consider the middle ring to be drugs, and the other ring are how you administer them.\nThis wheel seems simple but actually encompasses all techniques from behaviour change theory.\nI helped the EQUATOR Network - based in Botnar - to use the wheel to do a behavioural analysis of the barriers and ideas, and to design intervention changes.\nWe were starting with a long list of ideas - 136 of them‚Ä¶"

    "text": "Item 5. Qualitative approach and research paradigm:\n\nThe research paradigm is the set of beliefs and assumptions that guide the research process. These commonly include positivist, post-positivist, constructivist or interpretivist, and critical theory. Qualitative research generally draws from a post-positivist or constructivist/interpretivist paradigm. We recommend identifying the research paradigm so that readers understand whether the researcher assumes that there is a single, objective reality (positivist or post-positivist) and has thus designed the study to describe this reality or whether the researcher assumes multiple, subjective realities and designed the study to describe these multiple realities, with no attempt to merge or reconcile these realities (constructivist/interpretivist). The paradigm has implications for the study design, approach, methods, and techniques to ensure rigor and trustworthiness.\nQualitative research includes an array of approaches and methodologies, both general (e.g., qualitative content analysis, general inductive approach) and specific (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenography). Since the research paradigm does not necessarily dictate particular approaches or methods, the approach should also be clearly defined. Stating the approach provides readers the opportunity to evaluate the fidelity of the research approach to the research question(s) and consider the rationale for modifications and deviations from the selected approach. Qualitative research also includes an array of methods that can be used across paradigms and approaches. (See also Item 10) The researcher should explain why the selected approach is appropriate for the research question, and provide references to theories or traditions that guide the use of the approach as needed.\n\n\nWe can do the same with entire paragraphs\nYou don‚Äôt need to read all this, but see if you tell how many things it‚Äôs advising you to write.\nIt‚Äôs not easy.\n‚Ä¶there are 4 things.\nmixed up with background information, justification, definitions."
